# Breadboard

A library for prototyping generative AI applications.

This library was inspired by the hardware maker community and their boundless creativity, how makers just wire stuff together and make amazing things with off-the-shelf parts and a [breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all).

This library is an attempt to bring the same spirit of creativity and simplicity to making generative AI applications.

## Installing the library

To install the library, run:

```sh
npm install @google-labs/breadboard
